//The purpose of this lab is to create a code that uses inheritance to find dimensions of shapes such as squares, rectangles, and spheres based on a user's entry of a radius, or side lengths.
// The experiment is an exercise in using the switch / case statement to allow the user to choose a different shape and find the dimensions of the shape
// the lab also exercises the student's skill in using a while loop to continue prompting the user which allows the user to choose more shapes and therefore more dimensions.
// The experiment uses a base class called Circle and methods for Circle and thereafter allows the children classes to inherit the methods from the base class.
