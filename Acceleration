// this is a program that allows the user to enter a time in seconds and then outputs how far an object will drop if it is in freefall for that lenght of time. 
Assume no friction or resistance from air and a constant acceleration of 32 feet per second due to gravity
use the equation Distance = 1/2 * acceleration * time * time
//

#include<iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
 int fallTimeSeconds;
 float distance;
 const int ACCELERATION = 32;
 cout << "Enter in time in seconds " ;
 cin  >> fallTimeSeconds;
 distance = 0.5 * ACCELERATION * (fallTimeSeconds*fallTimeSeconds);
 cout << " The object would fall " << distance << " feet. " << endl;
 
 return 0;   

   
    
    
    
    
}
